## Research purpose
Identify hypotheses that will help increase the revenue of the online store.

## Research description  
Prepare a list of hypotheses to increase revenue of a large online store.
Prioritize hypotheses, run an A/B test and analyze the results.

## Project summary
From the above, we can conclude that the test should be stopped.  
Significant differences between the groups in terms of conversion were revealed - group B has a higher conversion rate.  
There is no statistically significant difference in the average check between the groups.
