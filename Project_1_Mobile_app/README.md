## Research description
Analyze the impact of events on the completion of the target event â€” viewing contacts
The dataset contains data on events committed in the "Unnecessary Things" mobile application. In it, users sell their unwanted items by posting them on a bulletin board.

## Project summary
10975 sessions has been allocated and has been reduced to 2296 sessions after eliminating double unique event sessions.  

The most common scenarios of successful event flow are:  
- contacts_show, map, tips_show                176
- contacts_show, photos_show, search_1          75
- contacts_call, contacts_show, photos_show     62
- contacts_call, contacts_show, search_1        59

There are statistically significant differences in conversion to "contacts_show" between the users who performed  
**favorites_add** and who did not.  

## Recommendations
In the order of impact:
1. Raise the conversion of "tips_show" and "map" 
2. Increase commission "photos_show" and "search_1" 
3. Increase commission "Favorites_add" 
4. Increase commission "tips_click" 
5. Raise the conversion "Advert_open"
