## Research purpose
To figure out the reason of the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment application profits decrease in the last few months. And help the company to bring back the profit growth.

## Research description  
Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the past few months. The task is to understand the reasons of profit decrease and help the company to growt the profit.  
Data contains server log of visits, purchases and advertising expenses on users registered from May 1 to October 27, 2019:  

## Project summary
FaceBoom is the worst in retention, but at the same time quite expensive advertising channel. It should be abandoned.  
And TipTop had an abnormal price increase - a multiple jump every month, perhaps we hit the peak of the channel's popularity. At the same time, TipTop supplies good users, but due to the increase in cost, the costs for them do not pay off.  
It is necessary to discuss cost reduction, it is possible to increase the volume of purchases at the expense of part of the budget on FaceBoom.

US has very responsive users, but there is a failure in retention, which results in a sharp increase in CAC. It is worth checking the technical side of retention for errors at all stages of the "user's life"

## Recommendations
Based on the charts of marketing metrics 8.3.1-2, we can recommend more promising channels than the problematic FaceBoom and expensive TipTop:
